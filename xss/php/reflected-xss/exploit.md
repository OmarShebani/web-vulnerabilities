## Reflected XSS

**Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a website, and these scripts are then reflected back to the user's browser.

This type of vulnerability allows a malicious hacker to execute scripts in the context of the user's browser, this can potentially leak sensetive data or perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.

---

An example is in the script provided **'reflected-xss-1.php'**,)you can execute any script on a user's browser if you make him request the link of the page adding a value containing the malicious script like this one:
`http://localhost:3000/search?searchItem=<script>alert('lol')</script>`

In a real case scenario, an attacker can do more than just this; they can steal user cookies gaining access to user sessions and sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user like unauthorized transactions or changing account settings.

**Solution:** Sanitizing any input provided by the user like how I did in **'fix-1.php'** script, whether by using a built-in or an external library, though they vary in the level of security and options, so it depends on your need and your application.
