## Command Injection

**Command Injection** allows an attacker to execute operating system commands on the server that is running the website/application.

An attacker can fully make the vulnerability compormise the application and its data, sometimes even parts of the hosting infrastructure. Besides, exploiting other systems connected to the server like within systems in an organization.

An example of **Path Traversal** is providied in the file **'/vulnerability.js'**,run the file with the terminal using the command `node vulnerability.js`. Then search the url `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, the site purpose is for pinging servers.

Write in the input field:
`; cat /etc/passwd`

As shown below, you have accessed sensetive information.

**Solution:** never call out to OS commands from application-layer code. In almost all cases, there are different ways to implement the required functionality using safer platform APIs.

If you have to call out to OS commands with user-supplied input, then you must perform strong input validation like in the file **'fix.js'**. Never attempt to sanitize input by escaping shell metacharacters. In practice, this is just too error-prone and vulnerable to being bypassed by a skilled attacker.
