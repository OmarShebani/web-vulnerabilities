## Stored XSS

**Stored XSS** is an attack where the malicious script is permanently stored on the targeted server, then served and displayed to other users when they access a particular page or a resource.

This type of vulnerability can carry out any of the actions that are applicable to the impact of **Reflected XSS**. however, **Stored XSS** has a bigger impact because the attacker does not need to find a way to induce the victim to make a request that contains their exploit unlike Reflected XSS. Rather, the attacker places their exploit in the application itself and simply waits for the users to encounter it.

An example of **Stored XSS** is provided in **'/vulnerability/index.js'**; run the server and open the website, enter this in one of the fields that show up:
`</script><script>alert()</script>`
When submitting this comment it will be stored in the server, then served and displayed to other users when they request this site triggering the exploit and an alert window pops up.

**Solution:** Sanitizing any input provided by the user like how I did in **'/fix/index.js'**.
