## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF)** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other. 

If the attacker succeeds to exploit the vulnerability, he can cause the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, change their password, or make a funds transfer. Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role within the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's data and functionality.

An example of **CSRF** is providied in the **'/vulnerability'** folder, run two servers for both files with the terminal using the commands `php -S localhost:3000 vulnerable-website.js` and `php -S localhost:4000 malicious-site.html` for the files **'vulnerable-website.php'** and **'malicious-site.html'**, respectively. Then write the url `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, as you can see, this section is for changing your email account.

Now if you visit this url for the other server (which runs **'malicious-site.html'**) `http://localhost:4000/`, notice the email address has changed to **hacker@example.com**.

**Solution:** The most robust way to defend against CSRF attacks is to include a CSRF token within relevant requests like what I did in **'/vulnerability/fixed-website.php'**. The token must meet the following criteria:

- Unpredictable with high entropy, as for session tokens in general.
- Tied to the user's session.
- Strictly validated in every case before the relevant action is executed.

Additionally, it is recommended explicitly setting your own **SameSite** restrictions with each cookie you issue and set it to **Strict** whenever possible. Even if all browsers eventually adopt the **Lax-by-default** policy, this isn't suitable for every cookie and can be more easily bypassed than **Strict** restrictions.
