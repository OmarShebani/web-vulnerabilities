## Path Traversal

**Path Traversal** is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include application code and data, credentials for back-end systems and sensitive operating system files.

In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server.

An example of **Path Traversal** is providied in the **'/vulnerability'** folder,run a php server with the terminal using the command `php -S localhost:3000`. Then search the url `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, as you can see, this page is for downloading wallpaper images.

Now if you visit this url `http://localhost:3000/image?filename=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, notice a senstive file has been downloaded.

**Solution:** The most effective way to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs altogether. Many application functions that do this can be rewritten to deliver the same behavior in a safer way like in.

 If you can't avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs, we recommend using two layers of defense to prevent attacks like in the folder **'/fix'**:

    - Validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, compare the user input with a whitelist of permitted values. If that isn't possible, verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as alphanumeric characters only.

    - After validating the supplied input, append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path. Verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory.
